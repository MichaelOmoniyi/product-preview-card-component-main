## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt the use of Google Fonts
<head>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fraunces:opsz@9..144&family=Montserrat:ital,wght@0,400;1,400;1,600&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
<head>
body{
    font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
    }

### Continued development

I'd love to master how to center my element properly, how to place right spacing between my element and also master the use of Flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me in centering my elements. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
